"""
All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
sqrt(n) = a0 + (1 / (a1 + (1 /  ...


(The full problem statement is difficult to reproduce in plain text. See https://projecteuler.net/problem=64 )

Exactly four continued fractions, for N <= 13 have an odd period.
How many continued fractions for N â‰¤ 10000 have an odd period?
